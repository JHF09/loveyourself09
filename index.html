      The mc is passonate about his work and curious about everything. He once
      oped everything in his house and somethings are closed and some things
      aren't. He has family problems which he ignores cause who cares. He
      doesn't cares if his parents love his or not. He's just a curius guy who
      studies a lot and became an engenier and hastes his parents cause they ate
      his entire childhood. He met one of his childhood friend whom he gave his
      marrage invitation. He's also getting married. Without his will ofcourse.
      He doesn't. cares cause it's an arrange marrage.
      <br />
      <br />
      If he has any problem he can divorce. It's not like he has any property
      which will go 75% or whatever. Seriously women in this world holds too
      much power yet still feminest exists saying they have a hard life. Mc is
      red. Red's fience is really beautiful. But for some reason red doesn't
      likes her. Grey's friend arvin asks why he does so. He says something that
      even he doesn't remembers. Grey was wondering to end this marrage but then
      thought that real love is impossible for a person like him cause he isn't
      willing to work go far enough for it. He'll just stay lonely and kill
      himself before he can gather strength to find true love. He was in his
      final year studies that the exams were complete. The graduation day was a
      few days ahead. Grey was at this college building. He was living in a room
      with his friend arvin. Arvin was going home and asked grey if he is goanna
      stay up night. Grey tells arvin that he'll go home after graduation.
      What'll he do going home for 3 days. Arvin tells that grey is wierd. Even
      if it's 2 days 2 days with family is still worth it. Right? For grey it
      isn't. Grey doesn't spends time with anyone. He isolates himself always
      since he likes to stay alone with his curious mind. Grey comes across a
      short format video about a man who create electric current to revert to
      the past and a phone was found.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey decided to create it since his mind was curious. stephine came to
      meet grey. She's grey's classmate. She asks grey what he was doing and
      after sharing his idea stephine was curious. Grey thought that she would
      start laughing but she didn't. He was also a curious soul that grey talked
      for hours. Then when it got morning. They both watched the morning sun
      rising from the widow. They were surprised tthemselves. Stephine decided
      to leave but grey then turned on the thing and it createed a wormhole type
      thing. It created a blast right in front of grey's face. Grey was
      transported to the past. He was shocked but also happy cause he always
      wanted to relive his entire life. He was crying out of hapiness. He was a
      wild child as a child. Cause he was smart and intelligent as a child. He
      didn't talked much at home but when he wsas outside with his friend no one
      could stop him. He was living his life. He also studied. He figured out
      that his memories or in fact sould came to the past maybe. That's what
      everything is. Since he got a good humor and smart enough he can spend his
      time with his friends that they'll like him too.
      <br />
      <br />
      He then remembers few dramas he created with his friend. He once punchered
      arvin's football causing him to cry. He'll not do that this time. He then
      rememberes that they had a ball that fell out in someone elses garden that
      he decided to get but he was ened up sitting in the stairs and getting
      caught by the scary landlord. But this time he managed to get the ball in
      time before the landlord came. He became good friends with his friends.
      It's time for school. Grey was sitting next to a girl. This made a huge
      racket in the classroom but grey wondered what's wrong. Then he remembered
      that it was taboo for them as a child. But who'll tell these kids. At
      tiffin priod grey was asked by that exact girl to meet somewhere. This
      surprised him since he never recieved a love letter in his childhood.
      Matter of fact he never talked to his friends properly after the age of 8.
      He's 7 right now. He did had friends that often talked to him but for some
      reason he had nothing to say. He accepts to talk to her in private. Arvin
      heard that and started a racket and grey barely managed to stop him. Grey
      then goes to meet her and decided not to hope up cause he knows something
      unexpected might happen. He then remembered that this girl looks a lot
      like stephine. Could she be. She tells grey that she's stephine.
      <br />
      <br />
      Nice to meet you. Grey was shocked. He didn't knew stephine was at the
      same class as him since childhood. Wait. They are gooanna change schools
      soon and go to all boys and all girls school. That's explains why grey
      doesn't rememberes antyhgin at all. He then asks her what she wants. Grey
      wondres what she...wait. didn't she got also caught in the explotion. DId
      she also came back to time? Grey asks her about it and she says yes. They
      talk how they are disrupting timeline with it and grey explained that they
      are not disrupting timeline. They have made a pathway to alter it. They
      are changing it. Maybe for the worse. Or better, who knows. They can't go
      back now. Not since grey didn't understood the maching himself that well
      to make a exact opposide. Magnetic current is quite hard to manupulate.
      But not impossible. They end their talk ang grey asks if there is
      something she wishes to alter and she explains that she does. grey
      rememberes that her parents died in an accident. She wants to alter that?
      That's good if she manages. Grey has nothing to do with it. Grey went back
      to his room and arvin told grey that one of their classmate got shcoekd by
      electreycity and died. Grey says that he doesn't cares since it's not one
      of his friends.
      <br />
      <br />
      Arvin tells grey that he's wierd. Grey thinks that maybe his this non care
      behavious is the problem he's facing. He at first goes and asks about the
      dead girl and realizes that she was just as cheerful as grey was during
      his childhod. He then became a machine for the rest of his life. He has
      forgotten his humanity that he felt when stephine complimented him. Maybe
      he's only caring about his openion and not caring about the other person's
      openion. That's what casued every problem. Grey griefs for the dead girl
      to the person he asked about. He then goes to meet stephie after the
      school. She was walking home when grey approched her. Stephine asks what
      made grey want to walk with her. Grey tells her that she used to be a lot
      cheerful but ever since she came to the past she's feeling dead inside. Is
      there anything wrong. Stephine has a complicated history. Her uncle was
      ill cause of something he ate. Then since he was ill they had to go to a
      different party and that uncle couldn't host a party. After they went to
      that party nothing happend. She fell asleap there. The next day when the
      uncle got good he invited them again. and nothing happend. She palyed with
      friends and everything. During the conversationg they wanted to go to
      their village house. So they went there. It was nice but during way home
      her father got into fight with some people who don't let taxi pass throw
      cause of buss. Then they werere coming home but some bikers distracted
      them causing the car to crash and killing her parents.
      <br />
      <br />
      Such a complicated history. They want to change the course of history.
      That day the traffic was not there so the car was speeding. Maybe they
      need to change one point in history. That's the uncle illness. Grey asks
      her to remember what his illness was. She remembers that it was dierrieah.
      Grey knows how to overthrow that. That fated day arrives. Insted of trying
      to makesure her uncle doesn't get's sick they'll do the exact opposide.
      Make him as sick as possible. So stephine had some spoiled potato kabab
      that still tastes good but it'll be enough to make someone ill. The plan
      was exicuted. The uncle at the thing and he'll stay at bed for a few days
      as she hopes but the exact opposide happends. Her uncle didn't ate
      proplery since he ate that wrotten food. A little gas laster he was just
      fine. The party will happen. She talks to grey from a online softower so
      even though she's using her mother's phone it won't save the messeges.
      Only she can password in to enter. Grey is using his laptop that he
      distroyed in the original timeline. Grey tells stephine that she doesn't
      needs to worry about it. He needs to know who suggested to go to the
      village house. And stephine doesn't remembers properly. Grey thinks for a
      while and thought that he was about to tell her to stop that person from
      creating such even. Grey tells stephine that they have managed to change a
      trigger point but the cause itself still exists.
      <br />
      <br />
      She must make sure that they won't go to the village house or else her
      parents will die. Stephine thought about it and told grey that didn't her
      parents died cause of car accident so could it be that it changed since a
      lot happend already. Grey tells her that the reason the death happend was
      they spend too much time around the bike area. that's why they got the
      chance to be distracted by wild bikers and died. Stephine got a idea. She
      thanks grey. She is goanna stall in case they go to the village hosue.
      They do go there and stephine stalls as much she can and they leave at a
      specifiq time. Cause that's when those guards don't stand there on top of
      that it's a time when the bike gang didn't ended up. That still has an
      hour to be go. But they stopped for a shooping and decided to go up. This
      time they directly encountered the bike group. Her father was really angry
      at those bikers cause of their behaviour and it started a fight causing
      police and everything. At last her parents were alive but not for soon.
      They were killed later on by those bikers. The same thing happend. Car
      accident. But this time it was a murder. Grey saw stephine crying who was
      lit up with hope before. Grey apologised for his good for nothing plan.
      Maybe if he didn't rushed too much they could have came up with a better
      plan. Stephine thanks grey. Grey notices that she doesn't have her scar
      that she originally had. Grey told her how beautiful she is and they got
      along. They then grew up. It's highschool.
      <br />
      <br />
      They are goanna be seperate. Stephine asks what'll happend then. Grey
      knows how highschool life is so it won't be a problem for him. Stephine
      tells grey if he isn't goanna meet her. Grey thinks and says that it's not
      like they are dating or anything that they have to occationally meet. But
      if she insists then he's willing to meet. Stephine get's angry. They
      exchange emails at least since they are at hightschool. A few years pass
      by and everything looks fine. Grey woke up dreaming about riding a cycle
      to the sky. He went to play. He's a avarage student even though original
      timeline he was a topper. He doesn't shows his talent so no one can tell
      him that he's a wasted potential. He then meets jessika from arvin who is
      his gf. Grey was shocked. He remembered that arvin once told him about
      jessika but he wasn't sure since it was a long time ago. Grey then
      remembers that he hated her for some reason and was so eager to end his
      relation that he got into a fight with his parents. He doesn't remembers
      the reason for some reason. His head get's dizzy. Jessika was giving grey
      a wierd look. They talk and grey happend to live near the exact place she
      lives. Grey knows this fact. The same road but a little further. Arvin
      left and they were left alone. Jessika takes grey to somewhere else and
      grey sees an extreamly beautiful scenery.
      <br />
      <br />
      He quickly asks jessika if she has a camera. She does. Grey takes a
      picture of her standing in front of water which was wholesome. Grey is a
      good photographer. Grey tells her that he does photography as hobby. He
      then tells her to show it to arvin when cause he'll definetely be happy.
      Jesika asks grey that he still doesn't remembers her. This confuses grey.
      Grey remembers that she said the exact thing when they first met during
      the conversation of their arrenge marrage. Grey asks jessika if they met
      before. Jessika says yes before leaving. Grey was wondering if he has the
      fare to ride a taxi. Jessika brought grey to this place to make him
      remember something? He wasn't even at the cirty few years ago. If he came
      here and met her wouldn't he remember by now. Grey goes home and asks
      about it to his mother and realizes that her parents are good friends with
      grey's parents. Since when? Since college. Grey asks his mother about the
      lake and if it has anything to do with her and his mother was confused for
      a while and then wondered for a while and told grey that wait. Did you two
      met there. Grey doesn't remembers that interaction. What did he said so
      important that she rememberd for years. Not just few, 10 of years. Grey
      wonderes if she liked him since that ago then arvin.. Grey calls arvin and
      tells him to speak somewhere no one can hear him. He then asks arvin if
      jessika asked anything about grey to him.
      <br />
      <br />
      Arvin thought about it and rememberd that she asked someting about grey
      that he told her. He went to check the messeges and told grey that she
      asked if he knew grey before arvin proposed her and she accepted to go on
      a few dates. Grey tells arvin that he thinks she might be intrested in
      grey. Arvin tells grey he isn't even handsome. Why does he thinks that.
      Grey said intrested. That doesn't necesserely mean she loves him or
      anything. Grey on his way home was taken to lake by jessika and there she
      asked grey if he had forgottend that. Grey doesn't remembers what she is
      talking about and when he asked his mother about it she said that they met
      there but hoe even she doesn't remembers. Such a small interaction that
      must mean grey said something to her that might forgatable for them but
      memorable for her that made her intrested in him for some reason. Like a
      thank you or a well being wish that no one told her before or something
      she needed to hear. Arvin tells grey that he's surely not sociable but
      smart. Grey asks how he isn't sociable. Arvin says that he avoids people.
      Grey wonderes if it was from habit cause he won't avoide people on
      intention. Arvin asks if he likes her and grey says that he certainly
      doesn't hates her at least not yet. Arvin asks grey if he should break up
      with her and grey refuses that.
      <br />
      <br />
      He says that if it's a matter about love then he shouldn't compromise.
      Arvin says that woman come and go but real love only comes once. Arvin
      doesn't have real love with her. He's a playboy after all. Nothing is
      coming to mind. Grey tries to force him to think something and arvin tells
      grey that he isn't as smart as him. Grey then tells arvin to ask for the
      photo from jessika that grey took. She'll surely leak out information by
      that. Arvin says good idea. But what photo did you took. Grey says that he
      has a photographi hobby. A few hours later grey recieved a call. It was
      from arvin. He got the photo from her. Arvin was shocked to see that she
      actually uploaded this in her instagram id. Surely got a lot of likes.
      Grey asks if he managed to get any info. Arvin told grey that he asked
      jessika if she had been friends with grey. An indirect question and
      jessika answered that they met quite often even in taxies they used to
      meet. Grey was confused since he never noticed her. But he does remember
      meeting her once or twice by chance but they didn't talked. Not a single
      word. Arvin doesn't knows. He knows one thing for certain that he can't
      light out the flames of his curiocity.
      <br />
      <br />
      He cuts the call. This leaves out a lot of questions that grey found
      unanswered. What was the reason he hated her and what was the reason for
      her intrest. His brain is hazy. A few days pass by and grey hears that
      jessika broke up with arvin. Cause she likes grey. He thinks grey is lucky
      dog. Grey is confused for everything. Arvin told grey that he should be
      happy. Grey said that he has different reason for worrying. He didn't
      liked her for some reason that he can't remember. Now it has became a
      problem. Arvin understands that but tells grey that it doesn't matter if
      he likes her or not. She's beautiful and hot. Grey doesn't likes this
      short of logic cause...never mind. It's not like he's getting married to
      her or even being her bf or anything. Jessika comes. She studies near. She
      has her bag. Arvin leaves grey alone this confuses grey. Grey talks to
      jessika and figures out that she is happy at life. He directly asks
      jessika that they met before but grey forgot their first interaction. So
      if she could then... Jessika thinks and was upste that grey forgot that
      day. She then turned around and told grey that he said I love you to her
      that day.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey doesn't believes and Jessika claims that it's the truth. He did said
      that to her. Grey forgot when he said that. Then he thought that even if
      he said that on the way of saying something else then how can the same
      thing he would do twice? He would have to notice. Matter of fact how is
      everything so perfectly together since a lot of his actions were different
      than the origianl timeline. It doesn't makes sence. Jessika tells grey
      that she thought after that day and she's happy to clear out that she also
      loves him. Grey was confused. He understood the reason she was mad at him
      but how does he not remember it if he really said something so important.
      How? Jessika says that she'll tell grey if they get married. Grey tries to
      resist since it's too much asking from her and jessike tells grey that his
      crime is that he forgot that he once said I love you to a girl and forgot.
      If he wants to know the reason then he must marry her. Grey thought that
      they are kids how are they gooanna marry eachother. Jessika says that she
      can wait. They can date eachother till then. Grey says that he also has an
      opinion. He can't just date her just cause he wants to know the reason.
      Jessika told grey that she knows grey is a curious guy who will do
      anything for his cuoricioty. Grey calls jessika stalker. Jessika even
      accepts that as a compliment. On this side grey's friends are introduced.
      <br />
      <br />
      Griffin, ali and arvin. With robert. They converse and a party short
      happen in school. Grey in the original timeline wasn't invited to the
      party. It's a farewell party for some kid. Wait he was indeed invited but
      couldn't arrive cause he only had few hours to play game. He can't believe
      himself sacrifising time with friends for games. He's really the worse.
      Stephine was at the school. Grey wonderes if his interaction with the
      timeline changed the history since grey never really met stephine before
      their 2nd year. They only knew eachother fior 2 years in the real
      timeline. Or maybe he just forgot her like the i love you part. Grey is
      sure that their conversation must have been something different that meant
      i love or such short. He must ask jessika that. Jessika came to talk to
      grey but she accidently pushed stephine causing her to almost fall from
      the building but grey heriockly saved her but in return he fell from a
      building hight. One story hight that he thought he can take but his chest
      started hurting. He put a lot of pressure on his chest. He layed on ground
      as ali came and told grey that he's an idiot for tryin out such stunt.
      Stephine thanked grey for his bravery and grey was decleared a hero but he
      returned home quickly cause he thinks his chest hurt. Some said it was
      pethetic, some said that he was uncool but everyone knew that grey had a
      pure heart and intentions. Not to pretend any hero.
      <br />
      <br />

      Everyone likes him regarless of whatever habits or behaviour he may have
      cause of his kind nature. He's like the soul of his friend group. while
      stephine was going home jessika caught her and asked some questions. She
      heard that stephine talks to grey since chyildhood. Stephine says that
      it's true. And jessika was annoyed by this. She asked stephine if she has
      fellings for grey since they look close. Stephine says that it isn't true.
      Jessika asked if she was good friends with grey and decided to hand her a
      hand of friendship. She leaves knowing her answer that she wanted to know.
      Then comes the dogh ball time where everybody plays doghball and grey uses
      his skills but gets hit by stephine in the end. Everyone knows grey did it
      on purpose. Stephine seems to have regained her smile again. While they
      were eating lunch grey told stephine to keep smiling cause she looks cute
      while smiling. Loosing the ability to smile is like loosing the ability to
      breath. Grey isn't saying it out of kind ness, it's out of experience.
      Stephine understood the meaning of it and everyone understood that
      something happend in grey's life that he didn't told nobody about it.
      Jessika asks about it and grey tells her that it was isolation and
      betrayal he faces. His family turned him into a living tool once. It was
      hard to be broken from shakels but he'll never forgive his parents for
      every scar they have given him. Grey was serious this time and arvin
      though grey was joking and grey didn't said anything and started smiling.
      <br />
      <br />

      Who cares if it was true or I just wanted to look cool. Stephine figures
      that she likes grey.Griffin knew that grey is showing fake smile but maybe
      something that the reality it may have but he isn't sure about it himself.
      A year passes and grey is still on text where stephine is still asking
      about wierd things like if grey likes this or that. Grey is annoyed but
      also preety cheerful cause everytime he opens phone some notification is
      waiting for him. Jessika calls grey out and tells him that she wishes to
      date him and grey has been delaying this for a long time already. They
      have exams coming soon and then grey'll leave this city. Jessika isn't
      willing to listen. She already told her father about it. Grey was
      confused. Then realized it. He asked what did her father said. He said
      that he will talk to his father. Grey told jessika that he'll have to
      reject her cause he doesn't remembers saying something like i love you to
      her and it's too forcing for him to marry her or be in a relation with her
      cause of something he doesn't even remembers. Jessika tells grey that but
      he did said it. She isn't lying. Grey then tells jessika that they should
      stop it cause he doesn't have a good feeling about it. He never had.
      Jessika then tells grey that he likes stephine doesn't he. But stephine
      doesn't likes him. If he rejects her now then what'll happend next? He'll
      be rejected by stephine.
      <br />
      <br />
      She'll think grey's a wierdow. And stop talking with someone she
      considered best friend. Later when his marrage age will come their parents
      will talk anyways. Then why not now when they can date and everything. Be
      sure of eachother and not make their life arrenged. Make it love. Grey
      couldn't disagree. He said that no overtexting. Then. She accpeted such
      codition. They started dating. After a few years pass they reached the
      point of the time grey came from. From now everything will be new to
      discover. That's how life always been. Grey went back to his home town. It
      was improved a lot. He didn't visited home for a long time. He didn't
      returned even in his original timeline. There is a new park where a group
      gathering will be. Grey was happy to be a part of it. Grey was cheking his
      emails and he got a lot of job applications that he got. He doesn't knows
      what to select. Arvin was surprised. They go to the park and ride on
      rides. Grey gets extreamly hungry. He then get's lost with griffin cause
      he wanted to ride a ride that nobody else wanted to ride. Standing ali
      asks stephine if she's in a relation with grey yet. She said no and ali
      asks if she likes him or not. She said yes and this made arvin confused.
      Jessika told stephine that too bad for you. He already confessed his love
      for me. This made stephine heart broken. Ali apologised to bring this
      topic up. Stephine asked when.
      <br />
      <br />
      Jessika told her that it was way long ago. When they were kids. Stephine
      doesn't believes that. She told jessika that she must be lying. Arvin told
      stephine that it's apperently true. The thing is even grey forgot about
      that event so he wouldn't have had told her. Stephine was heart broken.
      Stephine was supposed to propose to grey today but she couldn't. Grey
      comes and he's extreamly motion sick. He can't ride car. He will stay and
      stephine wanted to stay too but seeing that none of his friends will leave
      without him she also stayed. Grey threw up and after that he was extreamly
      fine. He slept the whole way throw. He woke up and noticed something. He
      asked if something happend. Stephine said nothing but grey noticed it and
      asked stephine what is wrong. Stephine asked grey if he loves jessika.
      Grey realized that he didn't told her that and he apologises for that
      since they do talk a lot so he may have given her the wrong idea. Stephine
      apologises for that and then grey inturupts her by saying that he can't
      say for certain that he loves jessika but he is indeed dating her. So that
      she can know cause grey is having a hard time adjusting which is bad for a
      healthy relation. Jessika was consern. She said that we talked about this.
      Grey said that Indeed. We talked about this. You'll tell me about out past
      conversation when we get married but are we goanna get married? are you
      even goanna date. Seems like you had your intentions fixed till marrage.
      Jessika started panicing.
      <br />
      <br />
      She asked if she did anything wrong. Grey says that some things doesn't
      add up and he's confused about some stuff. He'll tell her when he
      understands the meaning of his own thoughts. Arvin thought that if grey is
      consern about something like hating her and forgetting the reason then
      that must mean something is bad about her. She even gave him a condition.
      Is she scamming him or forcing to marry insted of taking slow like
      checkmating within time limit. And saying I love you short of stuff is too
      wierd for kids to say. Normally it's too emabrassing but since grey isn't
      saying anything about it then that must mean even he knows he might have
      said something like that or he might say something similer to someone.
      Jessika asks if grey's suspecting her for doing something wrong. Grey says
      yes. Jessika respects grey for his honesty and genuin care. But she must
      know the reason for grey's supecion. Grey asks her that if she did
      something wrong on intetion then she won't do it again in the future. And
      if she did it on subconcious mind then due to havit she may do it again so
      it's upto time for grey to know what it was. That's the reason he won't
      tell her. Ali asks what was the purpose grey told her. Grey said that he
      said enough to extenguise her curiocity and didn't said enough to burn her
      real answer. Jessika get's angry. Grey tells her that it's normal for
      people to suspect a little.
      <br />
      <br />
      Relax since it's not a big deal if she didn't do anything. Jessika tells
      grey that she's getting ofended by grey's choise of words. Grey asks
      jessika why she's trying to act ofended even though her behavious says
      otherwise. She doesn't understands. Grey explains that she knows how grey
      acts and his choice of words that he says with utmost honesty. He rather
      speak the ugly truth than speak preety lies to please her. Jessika says
      that if grey keeps doing this their relation is goanna fall apart. She
      started crying and grey tried comforting her. He told her that he is just
      being serious about their relationship and behaviour. Cause without
      learning about eachother to the deepest they can't even hope to get
      married if she wishes that. She still has their secret conversation to
      tell him. This sweet talk makes stephine jealous. They graduate then. Grey
      strats job and just like the usual timeline the marrage talk is going on
      between grey's and jessika's parents. Grey noticed that stephine stopped
      talking to grey. Grey decided to call her and her phone is not turning on.
      Stephine is deeply depressed. She's crying. She decided not to pick up the
      phone. Grey decided to host a trip in the celebration of stephine's
      birthday. They are going to mountain in their own country. Apperently this
      year snow fell which usually doesn't happends but it did this time.
      Probapally cause of global warming.
      <br />
      <br />
      Stephine was not going to come but grey forsed her to come he made all the
      plans and made sure she'll have the best of time. Then while talking to
      jessika grey realized the real reason he hated her. She's a mnupulator.
      She was trying to manupulate grey since eveything and was it for what
      reason. Does she really love him or otherwise. Grey knows one thing for
      certain that she'll end up ruining her so grey decided to avoide her the
      rest of the day and made sure stephine had the best of birthday. When
      asked for why grey told her that she seemed depressed. Grey told her to
      live the best of live and be happy. Stephine then turned into jessika and
      then arvin suddenly pops out of nowhere. Then he hears his parents. And
      then some doctor. Wake up. Grey wakes up. Turns out he was dreaming the
      whole time. Grey asks what happend. The doctor told grey that on the side
      room of his aprtment some students were doing experiments and apperently
      one of them blew up the roof or so creating a blast. Apperently grey
      thankfully survibed for stephine's help otherwise both of them would be in
      heaven now. Grey asks why both of them. Doctor tells grey that since the
      roof fell down it makes sence for some reason. Such a wierd case. Grey
      realizeses that he's been dreaming this entire time. That explains every
      inconstency he had. Grey was admitted to hospital by stephine but she's
      nowhere to be seen. Grey remembers that she didn't traveled back with him
      this time. Her relation with grey is different now.
      <br />
      <br />
      They are not that close. Jessika comes. She asks how grey is and grey asks
      her about the thing grey forgot about her. She told grey that grey once
      said I love you to her. Why and how. Grey needs to know. Jessika was
      confused and grey explained that when the explotion happend grey got
      unconcious. Due to the circumastances grey's brain started playing
      simulations of reality based on present information in his brain making
      him think that he went back to time. But even then he couldn't remember
      what he said to her or when or how he met her. Jessika asks grey if they
      got married in grey's dream and grey tells jessika that no. Jessika
      griefs. Jessika tells grey that she'll tell grey about it when they get
      married. Grey thinks for a while and says that he wants to stay alone for
      a while. Jessika leaves. Grey calls stephine and asks what she's doing and
      she says that she's just eating from food stall. Just the goofy girl she
      is. Grey thanks her for saving his life. She says that it was nothing. She
      just needed to carry him like a dead body. It was nice that he didn't
      actually died on her otherwise she would have been cased for murder. Grey
      laughs at the joke and ends the call. Grey then after a few days get's
      home and meets his parents when the female cast came. Grey told his father
      and requested that he does not want the marrage to happen. His father was
      refusing but he insissted. His father told grey to talk to jessika. Grey
      decided to take her to outside since there is a good chance she might
      start a scean.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey takes her to his old aprtment that he used to live rent. He still
      pays bill cause of his stuff. He told jessika the reason he can't marry
      her and his mother ruined his life and she has similer behaviour that he
      can't accpet. He won't be able to accept her and he doesn't want to live a
      lie. He tells her no in front of face even though she was crying for the
      rejection. Jessika wanted to know if there was no other way. Grey told her
      to find someone who can truley love her cause her behaviour only has
      truama and hate for her. Grey takes off his shirt of shows jessika his
      permenet scars on his body. That's what he got from his parent. Most of
      those cause of his mother's sceams. Those scars aren't something he can
      forget. As said he has truama over those. Jessika understands it. and
      let's grey go. Stephine remembers how it was back then. She ran away from
      home cause she wasn't being treated well and wanted to run away but stayed
      near the pond. Grey's mother was passing throw the place. She spotted her
      and left with small talk. Then they go to some relatives house and grey
      started eating. Jessika was still standing there. Grey asked his mother
      when they'll go home and his mother reveales that they don't intend to go
      home tonight. Grey snatches the key from his mother and decided to go
      home. He's brave enough to live alone. On his way home he met jessika.
      <br />
      <br />
      After hearing her depressing story he gives her advice to live on and love
      yourself. Tell yourself-I love you. Jessika can never forget that line.
      She thanks grey and wanted to ask him to take him home but couldn't
      courage to. She really loved him even though she did lie to him about many
      things and sceams just to get to him. Grey goes home and get's a fight
      with his father for not listening to his embarasement for everything. Grey
      told his father that he isn't his tool anymore that will do anything at
      all he wishes. He has a job. A life. Feeling that he certainly doesn't
      cares for. His father started hitting him and telling him that you'll
      marry her or leave my house. Someone was standing at the glass in the
      place. He get's out. Turns out it was her father. Grey's father was
      embarassed. Jessika's father asked why grey refuses to marry her. He was
      willing to do so when they asked. Grey said that he doesn't want to cause
      he already ruined his entire child hood cause of some woman. He won't let
      the same thing happen. Being born isn't something he could have controlled
      but he can defenetely know whom to marry. Her father told his father that
      they are canceling the deal. If he wishes to continue the deal grey must
      marry jessika cause she loves him and wishes to do whatever it takes to do
      so. The deal is the only thing his father can help with. But if grey
      himself doesn't want to then there is no intrest for his deal. Grey hears
      him leave. He looks at his father and he's so angry. His father asks what
      he wants.
      <br />
      <br />
      When he went to hit grey grey threw his father back. He asked if he sold
      his son for some deal. After hearing his mother giving out excueses for
      everything grey leaves. He leaves everything and tells them that he isn't
      coming back. His father was extreamly happy that he left but his mother as
      a sceamer made a quarell with his father to get him. Grey took his bad and
      left and was looking at his cycle. His cycle was one of the few things as
      a child he recieved which made him think that his parents love him. Even
      if it was a lie he doesn't want to loose this thing he loves. He was
      hasitating but he took the cycle anyways. He's on road now. No place to
      go. He decided not to pay the bill for the house anymore cause his parents
      might be there. He'll return to his graduation place and find a job there.
      Stephine was near. She came near grey and offered him something to eat.
      Grey asked what she was doing and grey looked at her scar. She came to
      eat. Grey told stephine that he broke their engagement. Stephine told grey
      that he did a good job since jessika had a bad reputation for her
      behaviour. Grey explains how he was in coma for 3 months and thought he
      went back to time with her and had such adventure. Stephine was amazed.
      She wanted to know if they kissed when grey told her that she fell in love
      with him in that reality. Grey was confused and said that his dream broke
      before that maybe. Stephine asks if they should now kiss.
      <br />
      <br />
      Grey realizes something. and tells stephine that he failed to save her
      parents even in his own imagination. Stephine doesn't cares. People die
      all the time. Clinging on to the past wont help. Being exicited for the
      future is something she waits for. Grey asks if she sees any future
      together. Stephine asks grey if he fleed from home and grey said that he
      was kicked out of home. Stephine says that she can see their future
      clearly. They are goanna have 3 kids and 2 of them will be girls. and one
      will want an ipad for his birthday and he'll do anything to get that ipad.
      Grey laughs and they walk home. To stephine's apertment.
